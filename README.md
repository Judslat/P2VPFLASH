FOR THOSE INTERESTED IN HOW THIS TOOL WORKS, IT SIMPLY HAS BUTTONS THAT YOU CLICK EACH BUTTON
RUNS EITHER A WEBLINK (TO LAUNCH A WEBPAGE) OR A BATCH FILE, YOU CAN SEE THE CONTENTS OF THE
BATCH FILES THEY ARE IN YOUR USER DIRECTORY IN P2PVFLASH FOLDER, JUST RIGHT CLICK AND CHOOSE 
EDIT OPTION, THERE IS NOTHING MALICIOUS BUT AS IT RUNS BATCH FILES SOME AV PROGRAMS WILL FLAG THIS
AS A POTENTIAL THREAT, IF YOU DONT WANT TO RUN THE EXE FILE THEN YOU CAN SIMPLY CLICK THE BATCH FILE
IN THE DIRECTORY MENTIONED ABOVE

LATEST VERSION IS THE STANDALONE PRODUCT, THIS IS AS IT SOUNDS A SINGLE PROGRAM WITH ALL 
THE NEEDED TOOLS BUILT INTO IT SO NO INSTALLER ROUTINE JUST DOWNLOAD AND RUN, HOWEVER WINDOWS

DONT LIKE THIS THEN USE V11 INSTEAD.
