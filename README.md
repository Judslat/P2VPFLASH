WITH HELP FROM CHATGPT I HAVE NOW MADE THE TOOL A STANDALONE TOOL
THERE IS NO INSTALL ROUTINE ALL FILES ARE NOW BUNDLED INTO THE 
EXE FILE JUST DOWNLOAD IT AND RUN IT.

IF YOU ARE A WIN7 USER PLEASE USE THAT VERSION AS THE STANDALONE VERSION WONT WORK WITH WIN7

This is the Phantom 2 Vision Plus Flashing tool
this is designed only for the above quad and no others

Click the green code button then click download zip
double click the DJI Phantom 2 vision Plus Flash tool V6.exe
and it will install and add a shortcut to the desktop

Tool has a step by step guide please follow it.

You will need NetFramework installed to run it.
